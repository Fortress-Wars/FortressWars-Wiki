## Slime Minion
Blocking damage will summon a slime that will fight for you. When the slime minion dies, if the owner is nearby it will affect them with absorption. The player can have at most 3 slimes.

Slimes interact just like players and can be healed, buffed, and damaged.

## Slime Armor
When right-clicked, all allies nearby will receive slime armor. While an ally has slime armor, they are immune to all fall damage and anvil damage. Slime armor will break if one of the conditions is true: Duration expires, fall damage is greater than **7** blocks, damage type is of type anvil, or entity is affected by fire/ice.
