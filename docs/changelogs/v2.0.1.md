  - Previously only the "default" gamerule awarded credits and saved statistics.

  - Previously if there was an uneven number of players + 1 on a team then the next player death on the team with more players would change team. (i.e. 4 red players and 2 blue players. The next red player that dies would join the blue team.)
  - Now, the teams will remain uneven unless new players join or existing players leave.
