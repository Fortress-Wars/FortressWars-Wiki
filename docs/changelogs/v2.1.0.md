## Overview

## Gamerule Voting

Players can now vote to play games with gamerules! Gamerule voting occurs in the lobby after map voting but before loading into a game. Players can vote using the `/game rule vote` command or the `Gamerule Voting` item in their hotbar.

At the end of the voting phase, the gamerule with the most votes is set to be played. If the voting phase ends with no votes, then the default gamerule is chosen.

Players now have an additional `15` seconds to prepare before before the game starts.
